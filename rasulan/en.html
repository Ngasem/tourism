            <h1>A Tradition to Show Gratitude and Homage to Ancestors: Rasulan in Dusun Ngasem</h1>

                <p>I remember the first time I came to Dusun Ngasem. It was at the end of June 2022 and the day was
                    scorching hot. It took approximately 30 minutes from our dormitory to Dusun Ngasem by motorcycle. My
                    sweats were all over the shirt I was wearing on the way to Dusun Ngasem. However, the journey was
                    paid off by the hospitality of the people in Ngasem to me as if they are welcoming their own family.

                <p>After almost three weeks in the village, on July 13th, 2022 specifically, I heard that there will be
                    a huge event held in Dusun Ngasem. Turned out the event is called Rasulan, a term that I have never
                    heard before. Rasulan is a tradition held every year in many regions in Gunungkidul Regency and is
                    also celebrated by people in Ngasem.</p>
                <p>The sun rose in the morning with the joyful news that Rasulan will be held soon. Even though the
                    weather was a bit cold, people in Ngasem were so excited to celebrate Rasulan. The street was full
                    of food stalls and various booths selling toys. The most favorable booth is a fishing booth where
                    kids were able to do fishing the provided fake fish. </p>

                </div>
                <p>After a delightful breakfast with Mr. Suwarno, I continued to follow the events of Rasulan by walking
                    around the sub-village. Began with walking to the south through the field that was decorated with
                    tents and pennants to enlive the event. There we could see a beautiful Ledhek dancer who danced
                    supply following the sounds of Gamelan, the traditional instrument of Java.</p>
                <p>Ledhek is the name of Java’s traditional dance that is accompanied by Javanese songs during the
                    dancer’s performance. The thing that makes it different from the other traditional dances is that
                    the songs are requested by the audience. Aside from its aim to entertain the people, Ledhek is also
                    believed to fertilize the farmland so that people will be bestowed with abundant harvests in the
                    years to come.

                <h2>Ngrancah Prosession</h2>
                <div class="articleIMG">
                    <img class="articlePT" src="./images/ngrancah.jpg" alt="Prosesi Ngrancah">
                </div>
                <p>The Ledhek dance was over at 1 p.m. The people had gathered around for the next session under a huge
                    tree beside the stage for Ledhek. That big tree is a sacred tree that marks the establishment of
                    Dusun Ngasem.</p>
                <p>The root of the tree looks immense and rooted to the ground. Some of the people there carried a big
                    package containing banana leaves filled with cooked chicken. The chicken that is qualified to be
                    cooked is a chicken that only has one color without any pattern. Furthermore, it is not allowed to
                    be tasted so that before the people are actually eating it together, no one knows how it tastes.
                    This year, the people in Ngasem cooked 25 chicken in total for this celebration.</p>
                <p>After the people were gathered under the tree, the feast called Ngrancah began. The event was started
                    by prayers led by the respected elder of the sub-village. Every person was given three pieces of
                    chicken that were covered with banana leaves. Before we started eating, we were expected to pray and
                    utter our wishes for the coming years, mainly wishes for fertility and prosperity. </p>
                <p>Ngrancah procession occurred for about 30 minutes where the people had to finish their dishes for
                    their wishes to be granted. The feast was concluded with closing remarks from the respected people
                    of Ngasem. The event was continued by Campursari until the evening. </p>

                <h2>The Rousing Campursari</h2>
                <div class="articleIMG">
                    <img class="articleLS" src="./images/campursari.JPG" alt="Pemusik Campursari">
                </div>
                <p>Campursari was held at the field behind Mr. Suwarno’s house. A big stage had been prepared for the
                    Campursari singer to perform. Not only that, Gamelan and the other instruments have been arranged
                    neatly on the stage. When the singer began to sing, I immediately sat in one of the seats provided
                    there. The people also seemed to enjoy the performance from their terrace. </p>
                <p>I felt quite starving after watching Campursari for a while. So, I decided to walk around and visit
                    one of the food stalls. I bought grilled sausage and rainbow syrup shaved ice with only 20.000
                    rupiahs! The grilled sausage tastes good, but the shaved ice is just bland.</p>
                <p>After strolling around, I came back to the field where Campursari takes place. There were many
                    adolescents dancing along enjoying the performance while holding some money from their pockets. It
                    has been a habit of the people to give a singer some money as a form of thankfulness for the songs.
                    This habit is also called as “sawer”.</p>
                <p>There was a man sitting beside me who did not look like a local. After having a chit-chat with him, I
                    acknowledge that he came from Jogja to Ngasem to watch Rasulan. He also told me that Rasulan exist
                    in his hometown as well but no one continue to perceive this tradition today. By watching Rasulan in
                    Ngasem, he felt very nostalgic. Rasulan is indeed a tradition that should be perceived.
                </p>
                <p>At 5 p.m, I asked for Mr. and Mrs. Suwarno’s permission to go back to the dormitory. I went back to
                    take a bath and take a rest. Besides, I also prepared to have a sleepover at Mr. Suwarno’s house
                    with my five other friends. The plan to have a sleepover at Mr. Suwarno’s house was due to the peak
                    event of Rasulan. So, the last event was Wayangan which began from 9 p.m to 4 a.m at dawn.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="articleSection">
                <h2>Wayangan</h2>
                <div class="articleIMG">
                    <img class="articleLS" src="./images/wayangan.jpg" alt="Dalang Sedang Memainkan Wayang">
                </div>
                <p>We came back to Dusun Ngasem to watch Wayangan at 8 p.m. The full moon was covered by thick clouds
                    that evening. It made the way to Dusun Ngasem quite dark. </p>
                <p>Arrived at Ngasem, the stage was prepared already for Wayangan. There are various sizes of Wayang
                    that are placed on the stage. The crowdy audience has filled the big tent at the sides of the stage.
                    Not only under the tent, people also brought their own mats to sit under the trees that surround the
                    field.</p>
                <p>The wind breezed quite strongly. Yet the cold evening did not discourage the people to watch
                    Wayangan. Shortly afterwards, the “dalang” came to the stage and the Wayang show started.
                </p>
                <p>During the first half an hour of the performance, everything was fine. However, suddenly it began to
                    rain afterward. People started to seek for a safe place, mostly in the terrace of their neighbors.
                    Even though they were watching while seeking for comfortable places, they still looked enthusiastic
                    to watch Wayang.
                </p>
                <p>The rain still refused to stop until midnight. The Dalang whose at the beginning was proficiently
                    playing the Wayang took a short break and then replaced by the Campursari singers. Some of the
                    people were seen leaving the field to their houses to take a rest but some of them were staying to
                    watch Wayang until the end.</p>
                <p>I then decided to take a rest as well from this hectic yet unique day. That’s all I can say about our
                    experience during the Rasulan tradition in Dusun Ngasem. Every minute of it was filled with
                    interesting things that I have never experienced before. Every step that I took was full of people’s
                    warmness. If there is a chance in the future to visit Dusun Ngasem again and experience Rasulan one
                    more time, I will be pleased to come back.</p>
